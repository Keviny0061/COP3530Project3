COP3530 Final Project: 
---------------------------
Area Danger Levels

Our program aims to provide a measurement of how safe where you live is in Alachua County!

The program sorts police reports in Alachua County for the past year and has them categorized. Based on the importance or weight that the user attaches to each category, the program then returns each postal code with its associated danger level value in ascending order.

The program uses quick sort, merge sort, and introsort algorithims on the dataset to demonstrate and compare how efficient each sort is.
